We have released this new tutorials website to facilitate your first steps with the code. We also aim to make it easy for everyone in the SU2 community to contribute with new tutorials, for the benefit of everyone!

This site is based on the [jekyll-doc-theme](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/) released on GitHub under the [MIT license](/Tutorials/jekyll-doc-theme-license). We greatly appreciate their contribution to the open source!
