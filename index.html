            <blockquote>
              <p>The SU2 suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software tools for 
              performing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis and solving PDE-constrained 
              optimization problems. The toolset was designed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
              and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but it has been (and keeps being) extended to treat arbitrary sets 
              of governing equations such as potential flow, elasticity, electrodynamics, 
              chemically-reacting flows, and many others. </p>
